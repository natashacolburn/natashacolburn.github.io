        <h1>Trans Support Sunday Acupuncture</h1>
        <p>
          Trans Support Sunday Acupuncture is not a business, but a monthly day
          of service providing gender-queer folks with acupuncture for support
          and stress management. We are two Licensed Acupuncturists,
          <a href="https://www.constantbalanceacupuncture.com/about-me"
            >Hilary Constant</a
          >
          and Natasha Colburn, who have regular day jobs working independently
          at Form Health Clinic. On every second Sunday of the month we
          magically transform into volunteer relief providers for any
          transgender, non-binary, or gender- expansive members of our community
          who want some blissful, luscious, relaxing support. Full 30-60 minute
          individual treatments are available by appointment. We see you, we
          honor your courage and authenticity, and weâ€™re here for you!

          first visit we will give you a call to confirm your appointment.
          Appointments are scheduled as 30 minute blocks but may actually be
          30-60 minutes long.
