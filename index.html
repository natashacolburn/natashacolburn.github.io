          Hello! I am a Licensed Acupuncturist with over 25 years of experience.
          I practice a gentle and dynamic Japanese style of acupuncture called
          Kiiko Matsumoto Style. KM Style uses palpation of the body and the
          instant feedback your body can give, to find the best constellation of
          points for you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you are seeking acupuncture for relief from pain, that will be our
          primary focus, but with KM Style acupuncture we will also
          simultaneously address underlying conditions. By helping to resolve
          longterm imbalances and older injuries, we make it easier for your
          body to quickly heal the injury or illness thatâ€™s showing up now. I
          work especially well with people who have:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Head and Neck Trauma, both acute and post-traumatic symptoms</li>
          <li>
            Immune Regulation issues like autoimmune disease, weak or overactive
            immune systems, and Long Covid
          </li>
          <li>Stress management, Anxiety, and PTSD</li>
          <li>
            Digestive issues I also use moxibustion, guasha, cupping,
            kinesiotape, and bodywork
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          I will give recommendations for Chinese Herbal Formulas, supplements,
          nutrition and movement. For patients wanting to use Chinese Herbal
          Formulas for complex issues, I will refer to an herbal specialist.
